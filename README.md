# Advent of Code

While studying functional programming through [F#](https://fsharp.org/) in 2024, I decided to get a bit more serious about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC). I've dabbled with it in previous years and various languages (C# and Ruby mostly), but the appeal of F# made me want to focus. And so here we are. I'm unlikely to attempt all of the problems, though.

Note that, per [AoC request](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#faq_copying), the puzzle inputs are not included in this repository.
